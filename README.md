# SkongModManager
a simple app that manages mods for Hollow Knight : Silksong that only works for windows currently.
this app is extremely simple and bearbones but i will try adding features like mod search and download in the future


# what does it do?
it basically moves files from the BepInEx plugins folder to a folder called plugins-disabled which BepInEx doesnt read
i'm also currently working to make this better and allow speedrunners disable BepInEx completely


this is what the ui looks like and what the file folders do
